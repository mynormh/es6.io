- There are some upgrades to object literals in ES6:
  - If the name of the property of an object and the variable you're assigning it have the same name you can just type the name once.
  - Function declarations don't need a property name anymore, or even the `function` keyword. You can just declare them like `myFunction(){}` inside the object.
  - Compute the property keys right inside the object literal.
