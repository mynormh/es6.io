- Maps are like Sets but, instead of working with arrays, it works with objects. A Map has a key and a value and can be accessed individually using `myMap.get("key")`.

- Maps can be looped over with a `.forEach()` or with a `for..of`.

- One of the main differences between a Map and a regular Object is that you can use an object as the key in a Map.

- Just like with WeakSets there are also WeakMaps. A Map has a size property but a WeakMap does not.
